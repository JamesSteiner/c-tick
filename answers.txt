1. The server.c file is intended to create a socket that listens to a
particular port of the host. When a connection request is accepted, it attempts
to write a certain file to the connecting client.

The client.c file is intended to create a client socket that reaches out to the
server socket and the hosted file is written to it.

2. In server.c:
line 20: 'if (argc != 2)' should be changed to 'if (argc != 3)' to ensure
there are 2 extra arguments

line 37: 'addr_sin' should be 'sin_addr'

in client.c:
line 28: typo - the variable is serveradr not serveraddr
